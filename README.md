===========
To install BioImageLib, you need 
first to compile the documentation:

- To generate the documentation, doxygen is mandatory. 
  It can be found at http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
  Once doxygen is installed, execute the following commands in a command shell:
  $ cd BioImageLib # Go to the root of the project 
  $ cd Doc
  $ doxygen Doxyfile
  The resulting documentation can be found in the html subdirectory, so you can read it with a browser. 
  By example, you can read it with the following command:
  $ firefox html/index.html

- Read the instructions in the documentation (BioImageLib/doc/html/index.html) to compile BioImageLib
